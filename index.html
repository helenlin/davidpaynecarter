              ITP and IMA are fortunate to have an excellent faculty of
              professors who effortlessly inspire, challenge and educate
              students in the intersection of technology and the
              multidisciplinary arts. David carries the heart of our
              department—he is passionate about physical computing and his love
              for the field shows through his teaching. He recognizes the unique
              backgrounds and interests of each student and integrates them into
              his curriculum, making his approach to physical computing,
              experience design, and interface design feel both relevant and
              personal. He is our choice for the 2025 David Payne-Carter Award
              for Excellence in Teaching.
