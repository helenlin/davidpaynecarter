            <div class="page-title-description">
              ITP and IMA are fortunate to have an excellent faculty of
              professors who effortlessly inspire, challenge and educate
              students in the intersection of technology and the
              multidisciplinary arts. David carries the heart of our
              department—he is passionate about physical computing and his love
              for the field shows through his teaching. He recognizes the unique
              backgrounds and interests of each student and integrates them into
              his curriculum, making his approach to physical computing,
              experience design, and interface design feel both relevant and
              personal. He is our choice for the 2025 David Payne-Carter Award
              for Excellence in Teaching.

                on the process. He is so clear in uplifting his values around
                the work we create. He always goes the extra mile to support
                bringing ideas to fruition, and I've seen this not only in the
                direct help he has offered me, but in how he approaches and
                works with all of his students, teaching assistants,
                collaborators, etc. I don't know what this award is, but if

                impactful on his students, that is David. -</span
